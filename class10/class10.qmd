## 1. The PDB  database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the PDB found at: http://www.rcsb.org/

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By Exp method and molecular type. 

#### First let's clean the data: 

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv('data.csv')

pdbstats
```

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as characters rather than numeric. 

I can fix this by replacing "," with the `sub()` function. 

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",", "", x)))
```

Or I can use the **readr** package and the `read_csv()` function. 

```{r}
library(readr)

pdbstats <- read_csv('data.csv')

pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)

df
```

>Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

total number of structures
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```

Percentage of the X-ray Structures: 

```{r}
xray_percent <- (sum(df$x_ray)/sum(df$total))*100

xray_percent
```

Percentage of Electron Microscopy

```{r}
em_percent <- (sum(df$em)/sum(df$total))*100

em_percent
```

82.8% of the structures are solved through X-ray while 10.75% are solved by Electron Microscopy. 

>Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
sum(df[1,'total'])/sum(df$total)
```


>Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

There are 2,298 HIV 1 protease structures in the current PDB. https://molstar.org/viewer/


## 2. Using Mol*

The main Mol* homepage at: 
We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession code (4 letter PDB code)

>Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We see one atom per water molecule because it allows for better visualization of the protein target of interest, and simplifies the overall structure. 

>Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

The conserved water molecule in this binding site is water-308

>Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## 3. Introduction to Bio 3D in R 

We can use the **bio3d** package for structural bioinformatics to read PDB data into R. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")

pdb
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

There are 198 amino acid residues in this pdb object

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```


>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

MK1

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

There are two chains (A and B)

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install along with **shiny**

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = 'pink')
```

## 4. Predicting functional dynamics

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")

adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
