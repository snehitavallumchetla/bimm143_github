Let's first read in the file to determine our sequence of interest: 
```{r}
library(bio3d)

sequences <- read.fasta('A16853399_mutant_seq.fa')
```

After performing a blast search of both the WT and Mutant sequences the identity of the protein was determined to be JAK2 (janus kinase 2) 

We can also determine where the mutations are between the two sequences: 
```{r}
score = conserv(sequences)
positions = which(score != 1)

print(positions)
```

There are 3 positions where the sequences do not align: 
```{r}
residues <- sequences$ali[,positions]
```


```{r}
paste(residues[,1], positions, residues[,2], sep = '')
```
